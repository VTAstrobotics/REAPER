float64 input_voltage #BUS VOLTAGE
float64 current_speed #in units/S either m/s or rot/s or rad/s; clarify which in your code
float64 current_current # in Amps
float64 current_applied_voltage # in volts, this is the duty cycle * input voltage
float64 current_position # the current position in m, rots, or radians, clarify which in your code
